\section{Squashed e-note model}
\label{appendix:squashed-e-note-model}

The squashed e-note model is a specialization of the Seraphis membership proof model that allows relatively simpler (and more efficient) proof structures.

First we will describe the model, then discuss how it satisfies relevant security requirements when applied to Seraphis.


\subsection{Model}
\label{appendix:squashed-e-note-model-model}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Require $G_0 = H_0$, and assume the discrete logarithm of $H_1$ with respect to any of $G_1,...,G_n$ is unknown (in addition to all the other assumptions from Section \ref{subsec:preliminaries-public-parameters}).

    \item Let $\mathbb{S}$ represent a set of tuples $[K_i, C_i]$, where\vspace{.115cm}
    \begin{align*}
        K_i &= z_i G_0 + s_{i,1} G_1 + s_{i,2} G_2 + ... + s_{i,n} G_n \\
        C_i &= x_i H_0 + a_{i,1} H_1
    \end{align*}

    \item Let $\mathbb{S}^t$ represent a set of `transformed' tuples $[K^t_i, C^t_i]$, where\vspace{.115cm}
    \begin{align*}
        K^t_i &= \mathcal{H}_6(K_i, C_i)*K_i \\
        C^t_i &= C_i
    \end{align*}

    \item Perform a range proof on each $C^t_i \in \mathbb{S}^t$ (recall Section \ref{subsubsec:confidential-transactions-range-proofs}).

    \item Let $\mathbb{Q}$ represent a set of squashed tuples $[Q_i]$, where\vspace{.115cm}
    \[Q_i = K^t_i + C^t_i\]

    \item Let $\tilde{S}$ represent a tuple $[K', C']$, where\vspace{.115cm}
    \begin{align*}
        K' &= z' G_0 + s'_1 G_1 + s'_2 G_2 + ... + s'_n G_n \\
        C' &= x' H_0 + a'_1 H_1
    \end{align*}

    \item Let $\tilde{Q} = K' + C'$.

    \item Demonstrate that, within a security parameter $k$, $\tilde{Q}$ corresponds to some $Q_{\pi} \in \mathbb{Q}$, where $\pi$ is unknown to the verifier, such that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The discrete log relation of $\tilde{Q} - Q_{\pi} = [(z' + x') - (\mathcal{H}_6(K_{\pi}, C_{\pi})*z_{\pi} + x_{\pi})]*G_0$ with respect to $G_0$ is known.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Perform a range proof on $C'$.

    \item Demonstrate knowledge of $z', s'_1,...,s'_n$ such that $K' = z' G_0 + s'_1 G_1 + s'_2 G_2 + ... + s'_n G_n$.
\end{enumerate}

The benefit of this specialization compared to the underlying membership proof model is you only need to prove the discrete log in one commitment to zero relation, rather than two. For example, with a SAG (e.g.\ LSAG \cite{Liu2004} without linking) or Groth/Bootle one-of-many proof on the set $\{\tilde{Q} - Q_i\}$. The efficiency implications are discussed in Section \ref{sec:efficiency}, which compares possible instantiations of Seraphis using the two models.


\subsection{Requirement satisfaction}
\label{appendix:squashed-e-note-model-req-satisfaction}

\subsubsection{Underlying membership proof model}

We argue that the squashed e-note model satisfies the underlying membership proof model.

Let $\mathbb{S}^t$ be the input to the underlying model. We will show that the following requirement, adapted from Section \ref{subsec:seraphis-membership proofs}, is met.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Demonstrate that, within a security parameter $k$, $\tilde{S}$ corresponds to some $S^t_{\pi} \in \mathbb{S}^t$, where $\pi$ is unknown to the verifier, such that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $s'_j == \mathcal{H}_6(K_{\pi}, C_{\pi})*s_{\pi,j}$ for $j \in 1,...,n$
        \item $a'_1 == a_{\pi,1}$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Observe the following.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The prover must know $[(z' + x') - (\mathcal{H}_6(K_{\pi}, C_{\pi})*z_{\pi} + x_{\pi})]$ and $z'$ to satisfy the squashed e-note model, and $x'$ and $x_{\pi}$ to construct the range proofs on $C'$ and $C^t_{\pi}$. Therefore the prover must know $\mathcal{H}_6(K_{\pi}, C_{\pi})*z_{\pi}$. The point $\mathcal{H}_6(K_{\pi}, C_{\pi})$ is considered `public knowledge', so the prover must also know $z_{\pi}$ (which may be 0).

    \item Range proofing $C_{\pi}$ and $C'$ means they have the form $x H_0 + a H_1$, implying they contain no $G_1,...,G_n$ components. Therefore, demonstrating discrete log with respect to $G_0$ in the commitment to zero $\tilde{Q} - Q_{\pi}$ means it must be the case that $s'_j == \mathcal{H}_6(K_{\pi}, C_{\pi})*s_{\pi,j}$ for $j \in 1,...,n$ (i.e.\ all factors of $G_1,...,G_n$ in $\tilde{Q}$ and $K'$ must come from $K_{\pi}$).

    \item Suppose $K_i$ has the form $K_i = z_i G_0 + s_{i,1} G_1 + s_{i,2} G_2 + ... + s_{i,n} G_n + e H_1$. Since the model requires a demonstration that $K'$ does not contain any $H_1$ components, and the commitment to zero $\tilde{Q} - Q_{\pi}$ means all non-$G_0$ components balance in those two points, it must be the case that $C' = x' H_0 + (a_{i,1} + \mathcal{H}_6(K_{\pi}, C_{\pi})*e)*H_1$. However, the term $\mathcal{H}_6(K_{\pi}, C_{\pi})$ is both uniformly distributed and implicitly dependent on the values $a_{i,1}$ and $e$, so the value $a'_1 = (a_{i,1} + \mathcal{H}_6(K_{\pi}, C_{\pi})*e)$ will be uniformly distributed in $\mathbb{Z}_l$ (assuming $e$ is non-zero). Since the range proof on $C'$ means that $a'_1$ must be in the range $[0,...,2^z - 1]$, if $e \neq 0$ then the probability that a range proof on $a'_1$ can succeed is $2^z/l$. This means $a'_1 == a_{i,1}$ can be assumed to be true within the security parameter $k$ if $1/k > 2^z/l$.\footnote{Typically $l \approx 2^{252} - 2^{256}$, $2^z = 2^{64}$, and $k = 2^{128}$; $1/2^{128} > 2^{64}/2^{252}$ is true.} [[[formalize better?]]]
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Seraphis structure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Note that a range proof on $C_i$ is equivalent to a range proof on $C^t_i$, since $C^t_i = C_i$. These range proofs will already exist, since membership proofs only reference e-notes in the ledger (which were created by transactions whose output e-notes' amount commitments were range proofed, or are coinbase e-notes whose amounts are known).

    \item Seraphis linking tags are computed from the output of a membership proof, namely the point $K'$ in $\tilde{S}$. However, $K'$ in the squashed e-note model applied to Seraphis has the form $K' = t_k G_0 + \mathcal{H}_6(K^o_{\pi}, C_{\pi})*[k^o_a*G_1 + k^o_b*G_2]$. This means linking tags will have the form $\tilde{K} = ((\mathcal{H}_6(K^o_{\pi}, C_{\pi})*k^o_b)/(\mathcal{H}_6(K^o_{\pi}, C_{\pi})*k^o_a))*X$. Since the terms $\mathcal{H}_6(K^o_{\pi}, C_{\pi})$ cancel each other, linking tags in this model are the same as in the base model.

    \item Step 10 in the above model is automatically satisfied by Seraphis because $K'$ is passed as input to the ownership/unspentness proof system, which demonstrates knowledge of the per-generator discrete log relations of its inputs.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Practical considerations}
\label{appendix:squashed-e-note-model-practical-considerations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Transaction verifiers can pre-compute steps 3 and 5 from the above model for every e-note in the ledger. The squashed tuples $Q_i$ can be stored in anticipation of new transactions that may require them.

    \item In transaction chaining (Section \ref{subsec:implementers-other-recommendations}), only step 8 in the above model needs to be deferred (assuming $Q_i$ values have been precomputed, and range proofs on $C_i$ already exist).
\end{enumerate}



\section{Composition proofs with Schnorr}
\label{appendix:composition-with-schnorr}

In this Appendix is one approach to satisfying the Seraphis ownership/unspentness proof requirements (Section \ref{subsec:seraphis-ownership-unspentness-proofs}), assuming $J == G_2$. First we lay out the proof system that satisfies those requirements, then we describe a proof structure in that system.\footnote{We leave applying the Fiat-Shamir transform \cite{fiat-shamir-transform} to the composition proof structure as an exercise for the reader.}


\subsection{Composition proof system}
\label{appendix:composition-proof-system}

[[[better terminology than `proof system'?]]]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume there is a group point $K = x G_0 + y G_1 + z G_2$.

    \item Let
    \begin{align*}
        K_{t1} &= (1/y)*K \\
        \tilde{K} &= (z/y)*G_2 \\
        K_{t2} &= K_{t1} - G_1 - \tilde{K}
    \end{align*}

    \item Demonstrate the discrete log of $K_{t1} = (1/y)*K$ with respect to $K$.

    \item Demonstrate the discrete log of $\tilde{K} = (z/y)*G_2$ with respect to $G_2$.

    \item Demonstrate the discrete log of $K_{t2} = (x/y)*G_0$ with respect to $G_0$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Seraphis requirements satisfaction}

[[[explain how it satisfies the requirements?]]]


\subsection{Composition proof structure}
\label{appendix:composition-proof-structure}

[[[better terminology than `proof structure'?]

Our proof structure is a Schnorr-like $\Sigma$-protocol between prover and verifier. Notably, for the discrete logs of $\tilde{K}$ and $K_{t2}$ from the proof system, we use the concise approach from \cite{clsag-eprint} to reduce proof sizes when constructing multiple proofs in parallel (i.e.\ reduce the number of responses required). Furthermore, we use the powers-of-$\mu$ approach from \cite{triptych-preprint} (i.e.\ `aggregation coefficients'), instead of distinct per-element hashes, for simplicity.

Note that if a composition proof is made for one input keyset ($n = 1$), then the proof structure degenerates into a plain tuple of Schnorr proofs (i.e.\ the aggregation coefficients disappear, since $\mu^0 = 1$).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose the prover has keys $[x_i, y_i, z_i, K_i]$ for $i \in 1,...,n$, where $K_i = x_i G_0 + y_i G_1 + z_i G_2$.

    \item The prover generates random scalars $\alpha_a, \alpha_b, \alpha_1, ..., \alpha_n \in_R \mathbb{Z}_l$.

    \item The prover computes $\alpha_a G_0$, $\alpha_b G_2$, $\alpha_i K_i$, $K_{t1,i} = (1/y_i)*K_i$, and $\tilde{K}_i = (z_i/y_i)*G_2$ for $i \in 1,...n$. He sends all of those to the verifier along with the keys $K_i$.

    \item The verifier generates random scalars $c, \mu_a, \mu_b \in_R \mathbb{Z}_l$ and sends them to the prover.

    \item The prover computes responses $r_a, r_b, r_1, ..., r_n$ and sends them to the verifier.\vspace{.115cm}
    \begin{align*}
        r_a &\equiv \alpha_a - c*(\sum^n_{i=1} \mu_a^{i-1}*(x_i/y_i)) \\
        r_b &\equiv \alpha_b - c*(\sum^n_{i=1} \mu_b^{i-1}*(z_i/y_i)) \\
        r_i &\equiv \alpha_i - c*(1/y_i)
    \end{align*}

    \item The verifier computes $K_{t2,i} = K_{t1,i} - G_1 - \tilde{K}_i$, then checks the following equalities. If any of them fail (or if $K_{t1,i}$ or $\tilde{K}_i$ equal the identity element $I$), then the prover has failed to satisfy the composition proof system.\vspace{.115cm}
    \begin{align*}
        \alpha_a G_0 &== r_a G_0 + c*(\sum^n_{i=1} \mu_a^{i-1}*K_{t2,i}) \\
        \alpha_b G_2 &== r_b G_2 + c*(\sum^n_{i=1} \mu_b^{i-1}*\tilde{K}_i) \\
        \alpha_i K_i &== r_i K_i + c*K_{t1,i}
    \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
